# Realtime_MERN

## Why GraphQL is awesome?

- Once single endpoint unlike multiple endpoints of REST API (to access different type of data you will use GraphQL type Definitions)
- Realtime Communication using GraphQL Subscriptions (Subscription Type)
- Easy and Declarative (Ask what data you need, nothing more or less) data fetching using GraphQL Queries (Query Type)
- Auto Generated DOCS

- REST to GraphQL
- REST API usually uses 4 types of HTTP Verbs - GET POST PUT DELETE to perform CRUD
- GET method is used to read/access data
- POST PUT DELETE is used to create/update/delete the source in Backend/Database

- It's almost similar to GraphQL
- At the heart of GraphQL, there are types
- Types > Query | Mutation | Subscription
- GraphQL uses 2 types queries and mutations to perform CRUD
- queries used to read/access data (similar to GET in REST API)
- Mutations used to create/update/delete (similar to POST PUT DELETE in REST API)

- Both Rest and GraphQL uses websockets for Realtime Communications
- GraphQL calls it Subscription Type
